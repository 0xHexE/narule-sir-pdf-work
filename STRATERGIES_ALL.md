Advanced Model Selection Strategies for Flower Federated Learning
1. FedAvgM (FedAvg with Momentum)
   Description: Applies momentum to the weight aggregation process, similar to momentum in optimization algorithms. This helps the global model converge faster and more stably by maintaining a weighted average of previous updates.
2. FedProx (Proximal Term Strategy)
   Description: Adds a proximal term to the client's local objective function to prevent clients from diverging too far from the global model. This is particularly useful when clients have heterogeneous data distributions.
3. Top-K Model Selection
   Description: Selects only the top K best-performing clients based on a chosen metric (accuracy, loss, etc.) and aggregates only their model updates. This focuses learning on high-quality contributions.
4. Adaptive Client Selection
   Description: Dynamically selects clients based on their historical performance. Maintains a performance history for each client and prioritizes those with consistently better results in subsequent rounds.
5. Ensemble Model Selection
   Description: Maintains an ensemble of models from previous rounds and averages them with the current model. This creates a more robust global model that's less susceptible to noisy updates.
6. Performance-Weighted Aggregation
   Description: Weights each client's contribution based on their performance metrics rather than just data quantity. Higher-performing clients have more influence on the aggregated model.
7. Gradient-Based Selection
   Description: Selects clients based on the quality and magnitude of their gradient updates rather than final model performance. This can identify clients providing the most informative updates.
8. Uncertainty-Aware Aggregation
   Description: Incorporates model uncertainty estimates from clients to weight their contributions. Clients with lower uncertainty (more confident predictions) are given higher weight.
9. Multi-Armed Bandit Selection
   Description: Uses reinforcement learning techniques to balance exploration (trying different clients) and exploitation (using known good clients) for optimal client selection.
10. Federated Dropout
    Description: Randomly drops out a subset of clients or model components during aggregation to improve model generalization and prevent overfitting to dominant clients.
